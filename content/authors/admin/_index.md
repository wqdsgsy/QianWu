I was born in Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Structured Materials and Dynamics Lab, working at the interface of applied physics and mechanical engineering. Fascinated by the non-Hermitian physics, my current interests are primarily on the investigation of rich elastic wave dynamics triggered by the marriage of topological phase and non-Hermiticity.

My PhD research focused mainly on exploring unconventional control over elastic waves with both passive and active metamaterial structures.

Outside the lab, I enjoy playing DOTA 2 and CSGO and watching pro tournaments.
