abstract: Inspired by the optical and acoustic non-Hermitian 𝒫𝒯 symmetric system, a 𝒫𝒯 symmetric metamaterial beam for flexural waves is proposed here, based on shunted piezoelectric patches. Positive and negative shunting resistances are the key to constructing the balanced loss and gain components. The associated asymmetric flexural wave scattering, 𝒫𝒯 phase transition and exceptional points are then investigated in both analytical and numerical ways. In addition, properties of exceptional points are tunable in our proposed system, simply owing to the variable shunting parameters. Our design may contribute to asymmetric wave control, enhanced sensing, amplification, and localization of flexural waves.
