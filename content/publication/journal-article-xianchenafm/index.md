abstract: Multifunctional metamaterials (MFMs) capable of energy harvesting and vibration control are particularly attractive for smart structures, wearable/biointegrated electronics, and intelligent robotics. Here, a novel MFM based on triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), which can harvest environmental energy and reduce vibration simultaneously, is reported. The unit cells of the MFM consist of a local resonator, an integrated contact- separation mode TENG, and spiral-shaped connecting beams. A multiphysics theoretical model is developed for quantitatively evaluating the performance of the MFM by including the mechanical and electrical fields interactions, which is further validated by experimental testing. It is demonstrated that the TENG-based MFM can not only effectively harvest vibration energy to power electronics but also dramatically suppress low-frequency mechanical vibration. This work provides a new design and model for developing novel TENG-based MFMs  for advanced smart systems used in a variety of applications.
